## Takahashi Method

> The Takahashi method is a technique deploying extremely simple and distilled visual slides for presentations.  

> Once Takahashi, a programmer, had to give a short presentation at a conference (RubyConf) so he first used the method and found it helpful, at least with Japanese. 

> The slides use plain text in a visual manner, to help the audience quickly read and understand the material. It's said to be helpful with Japanese and other eastern languages which use non-Latin alphabets.
